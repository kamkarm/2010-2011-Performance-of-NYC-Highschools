# 2010-2011-Performance-of-NYC-Highschools
ETL Process

This project I will extract, transform, and load three datasets into a local database.

Using Pandas, the datasets are extracted, cleaned, then loaded into three tables in the database.
Then using sqlite, the tables are merged into one table, extracting unique attribues from each table.
I then query the best schools from the table.

Datasets provide data on the performance of NYC Highschools during the 2010-2011 school year and can be found at:
